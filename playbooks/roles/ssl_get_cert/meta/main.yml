    This role gets a signed ssl cert file from the local Micro CA for use on the local net.
    Currently not handled is renewing certs when they expire, this should be simple to
    implement but is not yet done. It takes quite a few variables:
      
    - `priv_key`

      - `dir` Requesting server's private key directory

      - `file` Requesting server's private key name

      - `encryption_alg`

      - `pass` The encryption algorithm used for the requesting server's private key

    - `CA_server`

      - `host` Hostname of the CA server as understood by ansible (ip or alias)

      - `certs_dir` CA server's certs directory

      - `priv_key`

        - `dir`  CA server's private key directory (usually, but not allways == `certs_dir`)

        - `file` CA server's private key name

        - `encryption_alg` The encryption algorithm used for the CA server's private key

        - `pass` The password for the private key, this should be in an ansible vault

      - `pub_key`

        - `dir` CA server's public key directory (usually, but not allways == `certs_dir`)

        - `file` CA server's public key name
